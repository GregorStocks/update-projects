# update-projects

a script to make the flow of "increment multiple projects' version numbers at the same time and update their dependencies on each other" a bit faster

## Usage

lein run project1 project2 project3 # assumes your username is gregor and you're on a Mac, obviously. will update project3's dependencies on project1 and project2 but not project1's on project2 or project3
